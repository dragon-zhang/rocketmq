/**
 * A MessageListenerConcurrently object is used to receive
 * asynchronously delivered messages periodically and concurrently.
 * For example, the top 10 orders can get an extra laptop,
 * the top 10-30 orders can get an extra tablet,
 * the top 30-100 orders can get an extra mobile phone,
 * and there is no extra reward for placing orders after 100.
 * We call the interval from 1-10 as "stage one",
 * the interval from 10-30 as "stage two",
 * the interval from 30-100 as "stage three",
 * and the interval from 100+ as "stage" four".
 * From an overall point of view, stages one, two, three, and four
 * are in order; from a partial point of view, such as stage one,
 * the internal stage is out of order.
 * The rewards are the same, why not concurrent consumption?
